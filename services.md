### _How can we collaborate?_
![](https://cigdemtongal.github.io/services.png)
>Every organization has inherent knowledge, creativity, and motivation within its people. But turning that into meaningful action and lasting change often needs the right framework. This is where I can help you unlock your organization’s collective intelligence.

### Facilitation & Training
Designing and hosting meetings, workshops, and retreats where diverse voices are heard.
Creating spaces for dialogue that lead to shared understanding, collaboration, and concrete course of action.
### Program & Project Design
Helping organizations shape initiatives in education, culture, or social development.
Coordinating projects from idea to implementation, with clear structures and realistic goals.
### Impact Assessment
Building frameworks that go beyond numbers to capture the real value of initiatives from the eyes of each and every stakeholder.
Supporting teams in reflecting on what worked, what didn’t, and what can be improved.
### Storytelling & Communication
Turning complex processes into clear, engaging stories that can be shared with funders, stakeholders, or the wider public.
Developing reports, narratives, or publications that highlight not only results but also the journey of change.
