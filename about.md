#### _A little bit about me_

_“Tapping into collective intelligence to create impact stories.”_

Stories have always been central to the way of seeing the world. In 2018, during a training with psychotherapist Jeffrey A. Kottler, I discovered how our brains process the stories we hear as if they were our own experiences. That moment explained a lifelong curiosity: why listening to others — their motivations, struggles, and turning points — had always fascinated me. In retrospect I realized this curiosity led me first to study sociology, and years later, during my master’s research in Strategic Communication Management, I examined the work of social entrepreneurs in Turkey, further deepening my interest in how change takes shape through people and organizations.

Over the past 15 years, I worked across academia, civil society and the private sector. My journey took me through different contexts, but it was as if I was following a common thread: bringing people together around ideas, facilitating collaboration, and making impact visible. 

Alongside my official roles as project assistant, research officer, lead of impact assessment or general coordinator, I kept on exploring facilitation, participatory leadership, non-violent communication, writing, and translation. Whether in professional settings or personal explorations like theater and drumming, I have always been drawn to practices that connect people and help them make sense of complex experiences.
